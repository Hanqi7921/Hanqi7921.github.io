**About Me** üë®‚Äçüéì
I am currently a junior majoring in Telecommunications Engineering at Shanghai University. My research interests primarily focus on Open Vocabulary and Object Detection. 
I am actively seeking academic collaborations and would be delighted to connect with like-minded individuals. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me via [email](lvhanqi@shu.edu.cn).
Since March 2024, I have been a member of the Great Team at Shanghai University, where I have had the privilege of advisored by [Professor Shugong Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=R0XE-twAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shiyi Mu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aG8sASkAAAAJ&hl=en). Together, we have explored various research topics and tackled challenging projects.
My broader research interests encompass Embodied Intelligence, Robotics, Multimodal Perception, and Autonomous Driving. I am always eager to engage in discussions and exchange ideas with others in these fields. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!
