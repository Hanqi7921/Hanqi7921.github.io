👨‍🎓**About Me** 
======
I am currently a junior majoring in Telecommunications Engineering at Shanghai University. My research interests primarily focus on Open Vocabulary 🔤 and Object Detection 🎯.   

I am actively seeking academic collaborations and would be delighted to connect with like-minded individuals. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me via [email](lvhanqi@shu.edu.cn)📧.  

Since March 2024, I have been a member of the Great Team at Shanghai University, where I have had the privilege of advisored by  [Professor Shugong Xu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=R0XE-twAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Shiyi Mu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aG8sASkAAAAJ&hl=en). Together, we have explored various research topics and tackled challenging projects.  

My broader research interests encompass Embodied Intelligence, Robotics, Multimodal Perception, and Autonomous Driving. I am always eager to engage in discussions and exchange ideas with others in these fields. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together👭!

🔥 Work
======
Although I've spent three years in college, I've participated in many competitions and activities, and I've gained a lot of experience in both software and hardware. Feel free to ask me any questions💁.

I am currently seeking a mentor who shares my interests to explore the unknown together in the world of academia. I firmly believe in the philosophy of  <span style="color: gold;">Think big, start small, scale fast</span>. This is not only my approach to academic research but also how I tackle life's challenges. I believe that through our joint efforts, we can creatively change the world🚀.
